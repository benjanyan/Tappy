Android client and Windows server for gameplay key input for osu! via the touchscreen

Still very much work in progress. The IP and keys are currently hard coded and would need to be changed.

The app only has one "key" and will alternate between two keys automatically and will press both keys if more than one finger touches the touchscreen. On releasing any finger, the key held down the longest will be released which can be an issue.
